# take_home_task2
Hello! This is a second implementation of the task requirements. The front-end is built in Svelte, and the RESTful API is implemented in Flask. I'm very new to Svelte, so I didn't manage to organise the code base very cleanly, unfortunately.

### How To Run

Run Flask API:

```sh
$ cd flask_api
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python run.py
```

Run Svelte Front-end:

```sh
$ cd svelte_dashie
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
